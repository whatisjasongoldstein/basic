# Basic.

A super basic static site starterkit I spun off while making [ZiggyForAmerica.com](https://ziggyforamerica.com).

```
npm install
npm start

# now go make some internet

# To build into the dist folder for hosting run
npm version patch
```

## Supports

* Nunjucks templates, with a fancy `render` include function and `markdown` filter
* SASS
* Babel+Rollup. Defaults to last 2 versions and IIFE
* Images, no processing yet
* Setup to work with GitHub pages by default
